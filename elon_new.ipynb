We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S  X to reduce resistive heating  Technically    Thanks  That is the nearterm danger of AI I didn \\x92 t mind DA2  DA1 was awesome  Mass Effect 2  talking about sequels  is amazing  Haha Maybe he should design flag of Mars 48 65 78 20 74 6f 20 74 65 78 74  I spoke with Korolev \\x92 s family today  He was one of the very best  U041A U043E U0440 U043E

would easily pay for itself  if that \\x92  Absolutely U0001F440 Probably a good one to design  engineer in Germany Even more Ok U0001F440 Berlin Model Y is the one to watch  That is a revolution in automotive body engineering  finally   True Wow  IHOP  GitHub are close Best use of the term \\x93 Full Stack \\x94  For sure  This is both great  terrifying  Everything we \\x92 ve ever sensed or thought has been  Yes Sorry  should hopefully be soon  Not actually a payout  just a vesting of stock options  It may never pay out  as the stock can \\x92 t b  No easy way to answer this in a tweet  but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority  Details Aug 28  AI symbiosis while u wait There \\x92 s some of that too True  it sounds so surreal  but the negative propaganda is still
